Data analysis project on the 2021-2022 Dallas Animal Shelter
Hi, this is my data analysis project on the Dallas animal shelter dataset for the fiscal years 2021-2022. The data set was downloaded from
https://www.dallasopendata.com/Services/Dallas-Animal-Shelter-Data-Fiscal-Year-2021-2022/uu3b-ppfz. 
The tools I used for this project included Excel Spreadsheets, SQL, And Tableau. 
Using Excel I performed data cleaning, data validation, and data wrangling. Through Excel, I also created pivot tables and dashboards to showcase the data being analyzed. 
Then I created four separate sheets titled Animal, Intake, Kennel, and Outcome; converted each sheet into a CSV, and imported it to MYSQL Workbench. 
Using SQL I performed data exploration throughout my queries. 
Using Tableau I explored my data further and visualized my findings by depicting them through charts, dashboards, and data stories.
